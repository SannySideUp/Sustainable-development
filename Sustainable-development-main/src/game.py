PIG DICE GAME RULES:

1. Players take turns rolling a single die.
2. On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want.
3. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn and their turn ends.
4. If a player rolls any other number (2-6), that number is added to their turn score.
5. A player can choose to "hold" at any time, adding their turn score to their total score.
6. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

STRATEGY:
- Rolling more increases your chance of getting a 1 and losing your turn score.
- Holding too early might not give you enough points to win.
- Balance risk and reward based on your current score and your opponent's score.
