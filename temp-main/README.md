# 🌍 Sustainable Development Game

A Python-based educational dice game was designed.  
This project demonstrates modular software design, testing, and documentation best practices.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Sustainable Development Game** is a command-line Python game that simulates sustainability-related choices using dice mechanics.  
It emphasizes:
- Object-oriented design
- Persistent high score tracking
- Intelligent AI opponent (different difficulty levels)
- Clear module separation and reusability
- Automatically generated documentation and UML diagrams





## 🧩 UML Documentation

This project includes automatically generated UML diagrams to visualize the structure of the codebase.  
The diagrams are created using **Pyreverse** (part of `pylint`) with **Graphviz** to produce graphical outputs.

### 📘 Generating UML Diagrams

To generate UML diagrams, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
make uml
```

## 📚 Code Documentation (HTML)

This project supports **automatically generated HTML documentation** based on the Python docstrings and module structure.  
The documentation is created using **Sphinx**, a popular documentation generator for Python projects.

### 🧠 Generating Documentation

You can regenerate the documentation at any time by running:

```bash
make doc
 ```
